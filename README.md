# Webscraping Project

## I wanted to retreive all the Super Bowl MVPs and store it into a database.

## I would be webscraping the data from espn.com

## The programming language I would be using is Python and its libraries: Pandas and Sqlite3

## At the end, I will demonstrate some queries to verify that my database is working correctly.
